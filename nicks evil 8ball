description of use

  user is told on screen not to use the button, but it is attractive and inevitably gets pushed. the wifi turns off (deauthenticates) for 10 minutes. 
  on screen prompts scold presser, tells them the wifi can be erstored early if they beat a mini game of snake or 100 button presses or whatever.
  if they fail, which they likely will (game not entirely impossible), then they will be subjected to 2 days of quiet chirping (akin to smoke alarm)
  game 3 can disable all penalties or make the deauthnticator run for 20 more minutes.
  IF presser declines to play, device will "whistle" while it waits and play birthday card music until second game is played, even after initial wifi

back end features
